title: useRefresh

```js
import {useRefresh} from 'muuri-react';
```

The `useRefresh` hook allow you to notify the MuuriComponent that the Item dimensions are changed, so that it can update the layout.

## Usage ðŸ“–

Given this simple style.

```css
/* Small item */
.item-small {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
}

/* Large item */
.item-large {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

The Item in the example below will change its dimensions every time it is clicked.
The useRefresh hook is used with the size value as a `dependency`. Like useEffect, it will activate whenever a dependency changes and it will notify the MuuriComponent to update the layout.

```jsx
const Item = () => {
  // Size is used as initial state.
  const [size, setSize] = useState('small');
  // Change the size.
  const changeSize = (size) => {
    if (size === 'large') return 'small';
    if (size === 'small') return 'large';
  };

  // Each time the dependency changes the grid size is updated.
  useRefresh([size]);

  return (
    <div className={`item item-${size}`}>
      <div className="item-content" onClick={() => setSize(changeSize)} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

It's also possible to notify the MuuriComponent using the `refresh` method returned by the hook. This method has fewer applications, but has the same effect as the previous one.

```jsx
const refresh = useRefresh();
// Call the method when the size changes.
useEffect(() => {
  refresh();
}, [size]);
```

The Item won't re-render after the hook took effect.
