title: useVisibility
---

```js
import {useVisibility} from 'muuri-react';
```

The `useVisibility` hook allow you to show/hide the Item in which the hook has been called.

## Usage ðŸ“–

It's possible to use the `setVisibility` method returned by the hook. It will accept as an argument a boolean representing the visibility of the Item.

```jsx
const Item = () => {
  const setVisibility = useVisibility();

  return (
    <div className="item">
      <div
        className="item-content"
        {/* Hide the item on click. */}
        onClick={() => setVisibility(false)}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

The Item won't re-render after the hook took effect, use [useShow](../hooks/useShow) for this purpose.

:::note
The setVisibility method has `no effect` when the component is mounting (basically when the Item is added). You have to decide if the Item has to be visible or hidden when you [add](../usage/items#visibility-) it.
