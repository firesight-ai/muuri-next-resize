title: Drag scroll üñ±Ô∏è
---

If you want to trigger scrolling on any element during dragging you can enable and configure through the prop of the MuuriComponent [dragAutoScroll](../api-reference/muuricomponent#dragautoscroll). By default this feature is disabled.

```jsx
const scrollElemRef = useRef();

<div style={{'overflow-y': 'scroll'}} ref={scrollElemRef}>
  <MuuriComponent
    dragEnabled
    dragAutoScroll={{
      targets: [
        // Scroll scrollElement (can be any scrollable element) on y-axis only.
        {element: scrollElemRef, axis: AutoScroller.AXIS_Y},
      ],
    }}
  />
</div>;
```

:::tip
When you use this feature it is _highly_ recommended that you create a `fixed` positioned element right under `document.body` and use that as the `dragContainer` for all the dragged Items. If you don't do this and a dragged Item's parent is auto-scrolled, the dragged Item will potentially grow the scrolled element's scroll area to infinity unintentionally.
