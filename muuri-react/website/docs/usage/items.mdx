## Add and remove items

To `add` or`remove` Items the MuuriComponent just have to be re-rendered with different children. <br/>
As you will see in the example below, it is good practice to store the Items data in the component `state`, modifyng this state will allow us to add or remove the Items we want.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  // Items.
  const [items, setItems] = useState([{id: '1'}, {id: '2'}, {id: '3'}]);

  // Items to components.
  const children = items.map((item) => <Item key={item.id} />);

  // The 'setItems' call will re-render the component with different items.
  const add = (id) => setItems(items.concat({id}));
  const remove = (id) => setItems(items.filter((item) => item.id !== id));

  // Render.
  return <MuuriComponent>{children}</MuuriComponent>;
};
```

It's possible to `both` remove and add Items in a single re-render.

## Add in position 📍

The new Items will be added in the same `position` in which they have been added in the children array.

```jsx
// Will insert the new item in the
// position represented by the index value
const addAt = (id, index) => {
  setItems([...items.slice(0, index), {id}, ...items.slice(index)]);
};
```

:::info
If a [sort](../usage/sorting) is used, it will have priority over choosing the **position** of the added items.
:::

## Visibility 👀

An Item can be added as `visible` or `hidden` based on the CSS display property which can be block or none. By default all added Items are shown, to change this you need to edit the [addOptions](../api-reference/muuricomponent#addoptions) property.

```jsx
<MuuriComponent addOptions={{show: false}} />
```

:::info
If a [filter](../usage/filtering) is used, it will have priority over choosing to **show**/**hide** items.

## Style features 👗

- It's possible to control the gaps between the Items by giving some `margin` to the Items (outer) elements.
- It's possible to see the `showing animations` when an Item is added by setting the CSS display property of the Item (outer) element to `none`.
